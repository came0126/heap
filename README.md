# Heap and Priority Queues
Extended data structure and sorting algorithm review. Implementation of heap and priority queue DS.
Project 3 from Wheaton College's CSCI Data Structures and Algorithms course.

-The heap is implementated as an abstract class utilizing an array as the underlying structure which keeps the properties as an almost complete binary tree.
-HeapSort uses the already implementated heap.
-HeapPriorityQueue uses a heap as the unlying structure with the functionality of a priority queue.
-PQQueue uses a Priority Queue as the unlying structure with the functionality of a queue.
-PQStack uses a Priority Queue as the unlying structure with the functionality of a stack.

*Note: Project tested emparically using JUnit test cases written by Dr. Thomas VanDrunen.*
