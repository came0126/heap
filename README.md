# Heap and Priority Queues
Extended data structure and sorting algorithm review. Implementation of heap and priority queue DS.
Project 3 from Wheaton College's CSCI Data Structures and Algorithms course.

- The heap is implementated as an abstract class utilizing an array as the underlying structure which keeps the properties as an almost complete binary tree.
- HeapSort uses the already implementated heap.
- HeapPriorityQueue uses a heap as the unlying structure with the functionality of a priority queue.
- PQQueue uses a Priority Queue as the unlying structure with the functionality of a queue.
- PQStack uses a Priority Queue as the unlying structure with the functionality of a stack.
